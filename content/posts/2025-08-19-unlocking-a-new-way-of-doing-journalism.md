Journalism is in a period of rapid and significant change. The latest Digital News Report reveals a challenging media landscape, where traditional news sources are seeing a decline in trust and engagement. However, an innovative experiment at Birmingham City University offers a glimpse into a more productive and high-quality future for the profession. By asking journalism students to keep an "AI diary," an instructor found that integrating AI into the creative and reporting process can unlock new levels of performance and critical thinking.   

### The Power of the Prompt
The core of the experiment was the AI diary, a tool that required students to log every interaction with AI tools, from idea generation to editing. This simple act had a profound effect. It externalized what is often an internal, "System 1" thought process—the fast, intuitive part of our brains—and forced students to engage in "System 2" thinking, which is slow, deliberate, and intentional.

Instead of rushing with the first story idea, students found themselves spending more time crafting specific prompts for AI. This process of intentional design led them to develop stronger, more well-thought-out story ideas. They identified better sources and created more strategic interview plans. The AI wasn't a shortcut; it was a forcing function for discipline and reflection.   

### A New Kind of Critical Thinking
Beyond improving the journalism itself, the AI diaries revealed a deeper engagement with academic material. Students didn't just quote literature at the end of their assignments; they actively applied it throughout their process, using their readings to design better prompts. This practical application solidified their understanding and helped them connect theoretical knowledge with real-world practice.

Perhaps most importantly, the exercise fostered a more nuanced perspective on AI. Students who began with strong pro- or anti-AI stances developed a more sophisticated understanding of the technology by the end of the module. This led to a healthy reduction in their trust in AI, a crucial step for developing the critical thinking skills necessary for modern journalism.

### The Journalist of Tomorrow
The experiment at Birmingham City University shows that the fear of AI replacing journalists is misguided. Instead, AI can become a powerful partner. It can take on the role of a research assistant, a tireless editor, or a brainstorming partner, freeing up journalists to focus on what they do best: original reporting, in-depth investigation, and building trust with their audience.

The next generation of journalists will do their work much better by leveraging products that embed AI to enhance their day-to-day work. The future of journalism isn't about competing with AI; it's about mastering it. This is not a choice, but an essential skill for anyone who wishes to thrive in the profession. And the time to start is now.
