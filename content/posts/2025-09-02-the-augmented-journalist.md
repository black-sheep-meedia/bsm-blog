The work of a journalist is a demanding blend of critical thinking, in-depth investigation, and compelling storytelling. However, a significant portion of a professional's time is often dedicated to foundational tasks that, while essential, can detract from the core mission of reporting. From transcribing interviews to formatting data and creating image descriptions, these duties consume valuable hours that could be better spent on investigative work and narrative development.

We believe that technology should serve to amplify journalists' professional capabilities, not diminish them. The approach to AI integration is not one of replacement, but of partnership - of human-machine collaboration. By automating these repetitive yet crucial processes, the journalists experience more freedom and can devote more focus to intellectually challenging tasks. Recently, [Financial Times has reported](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lizlohn_144-pieces-of-alt-text-were-generated-by-activity-7366363883835457536-aOek) on how they implemented AI to automate the generation of image alt text â€” a critical accessibility function. This system, which now operates under human oversight and fact-checking, exemplifies how AI can handle the systematic tasks, allowing journalists to concentrate on the human-centric aspects of their work.

The value of a journalist lies, among other things, in their unique perspective, their ability to ask penetrating questions, and their skill in crafting a narrative that resonates with an audience. By offloading the mechanical burdens, AI can empower them to dedicate their expertise to what truly matters. This is not merely an incremental technological improvement; it is a strategic shift designed to enhance the quality of their work and the efficiency of their day.
