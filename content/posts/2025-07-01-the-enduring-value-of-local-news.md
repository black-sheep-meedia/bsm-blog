The [Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism's Digital News Report 2025](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-06/Digital_News-Report_2025.pdf) provides key insights into the kinds of local information audiences are looking for and how they prefer to get it, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for publishers.

While many people may express concern about the decline of local news, a large majority of the population still regularly accesses information about their communities. On average, across 45 markets, 81% of respondents have accessed at least one type of local information in the past week. People are most interested in general local news stories, such as those about crimes or accidents, which are sought out by nearly half of the respondents. Local activities and culture, as well as local information services like weather or public transit schedules, are also very popular. Interestingly, local politics and government news, often considered a core function of local media, is accessed by just one-third of respondents. This general pattern of information needs remains largely consistent across different countries, even if the overall level of engagement varies.

The report also shows a clear split in how audiences get their information. Local news media, which includes local television, newspapers, and radio, are still seen as the best source for topics like local politics, general news, and local notices. On the other hand, digital platforms like social media and search engines are becoming the preferred source for more transactional, or "commoditized," information. This includes things like local buying and selling, local services, and local activities and culture. This shift is often because platforms offer greater convenience and a better user experience for these types of information. While this trend is widespread, it's more pronounced in some countries than in others. In places like Germany and Norway, news media remain the dominant source for most local topics, while in countries like Morocco and Malaysia, platforms are the preferred source for nearly all types of local information.

This data makes it clear that the trends affecting news consumption as a whole are also shaping the local news market. The report suggests that in countries where people primarily get their online news from search and social platforms, they are also more likely to prefer platforms for local information. For publishers, this means their strategy must be tailored to their specific market. In countries with low platform usage, it's crucial for publishers to maintain a direct relationship with their audience. For most publishers, particularly those in the US and UK, the key is to identify which types of information audiences will turn to them for and to focus on those areas. By investing in high-quality, unique digital content, publishers can create value that audiences will seek out and even pay for.
