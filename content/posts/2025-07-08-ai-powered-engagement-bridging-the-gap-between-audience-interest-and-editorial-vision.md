In an era marked by declining news engagement and a growing tendency for audiences to avoid news, especially among younger demographics, media organizations are increasingly looking to artificial intelligence to drive personalization and build loyalty. While the concept of tailoring content to individuals isn't new, recent advancements in AI have made a new scale of personalized experiences technically feasible. [A recent study](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-06/Digital_News-Report_2025.pdf) provides critical insights into how audiences feel about these technologies, offering a strategic guide for media executives.

The study reveals that while a significant portion of the public is open to news personalization, their comfort level is considerably lower compared to other digital domains. For example, people are much more at ease with automated content selection for weather (63% comfortable), music (57% comfortable), or online movies (55% comfortable). Comfort with news personalization is notably lower, at just 49% and it's lowest for social media and video feeds (43%). This cautious attitude toward personalized news stems from various concerns. Some individuals worry that algorithms might introduce more bias or manipulation, potentially creating echo chambers. Others fear they could miss important stories if their news feed is too narrowly tailored to their interests, preferring a more general overview. Concerns about privacy and surveillance also feature prominently.

However, the analysis also identifies a number of perceived benefits that drive some people to embrace personalization. Many feel it provides them with more relevant information. A good number also appreciate that it saves them time and effort by filtering out topics they find uninteresting. A smaller but distinct group even trusts algorithms more than human editors, believing they are less biased.

When it comes to AI-driven personalization, the study highlights a clear difference between what audiences want and what news leaders are focusing on. Public interest in these new tools is generally low, with no single option attracting more than a third of the audience. The highest interest is in tools that make news consumption more efficient, such as article summarization (27% interested) and article translation (24% interested). Despite this, a large majority of media executives are focused on implementing "text to audio" tools, with 75% planning to introduce this, even though it garners very little public interest (15%). In contrast, a similar number of executives (70%) are planning to introduce article summarization, which has a much higher level of public interest.

This divergence suggests that news organizations must be thoughtful about their AI strategies. The enthusiasm for these tools varies greatly by country and by age group. Younger audiences, who are generally more comfortable with AI, show a greater interest in features like chatbots and articles adapted for different reading levels. For media executives, this indicates a need to offer a variety of options to appeal to a broad range of users. By clearly communicating the purpose of these AI technologies and giving users some control over them, publishers can build trust and address public concerns as they introduce more ambitious AI initiatives.
