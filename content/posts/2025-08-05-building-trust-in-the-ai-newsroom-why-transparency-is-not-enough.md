As newsrooms increasingly integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, a critical challenge has emerged: audience skepticism. Many news consumers are uneasy about AI, and this distrust often extends to its use in journalism, regardless of the potential benefits. While a simple disclosure that AI was used might seem like the solution, [new research suggests](https://trustingnews.org/trustkits/ai/) that transparency alone is not enough to secure trust. In fact, some audiences express less trust after seeing a disclosure, even when it includes details about human oversight. The real work of building trust lies in a more proactive and holistic approach.

The first step is to listen and engage with the audience. Newsrooms must move beyond simply informing the public and instead open a dialogue to understand their concerns, fears, and expectations regarding AI. The case of ARLnow provides a powerful example of this in practice. After receiving audience feedback expressing discomfort with AI-generated images, the newsroom listened and opted to replace them with human-created illustrations. This decision, based on a genuine understanding of audience needs, demonstrates a commitment to responsiveness that builds a sense of partnership and strengthens community relationships.

Once a newsroom understands its audience, it can then build a framework of ethical use and education. AI should be viewed as a tool in the journalism toolkit, never a replacement for the value, skills, and thoughtfulness of human reporters. By consistently adhering to core ethical principles—accuracy, fairness, and minimizing harm—news organizations can reinforce their role as trusted sources. Furthermore, educating the community about how AI works and how it is responsibly used in the newsroom can demystify the technology. By actively helping the public understand the role of AI, journalists can empower their audience to critically evaluate its role in the world and make informed decisions about its use.

Ultimately, building trust with an AI-cautious audience is a continuous process. It requires more than a simple statement of disclosure; it demands a deep commitment to listening, acting with transparency, adhering to a clear ethical code, and educating the community. For media leaders, this is a unique opportunity to demonstrate their value and reinforce the foundational trust that underpins all journalism.
