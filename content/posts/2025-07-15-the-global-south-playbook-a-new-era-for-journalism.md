The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has initiated a profound shift within the journalism industry. While the conversation has often been centered on Western markets, a [new study](https://www.trust.org/resource/ai-revolution-journalists-global-south) by the Thomson Reuters Foundation sheds critical light on how journalists in the Global South and emerging economies are actively engaging with this transformative technology. The findings reveal a landscape of both widespread adoption and significant, unique challenges, offering a roadmap for media leaders to steer their organizations into this new era.

### A Cautious Embrace of AI
The study, based on a survey of over 200 journalists across 70 countries, found that the adoption of AI tools is far from a niche practice. A significant majority of respondents, over 80%, reported using AI in their professional work, with nearly half integrating these tools into their daily routines for tasks such as research, content drafting, translation, and fact-checking. This widespread use points to a clear, pragmatic response to AI's potential to enhance efficiency and streamline workflows.

Despite this high rate of individual adoption, a striking paradox exists: a significant majority of newsrooms—nearly eight out of ten—lack any formal policy on AI use. This gap between individual initiative and organizational strategy highlights a critical need for leadership to formalize guidelines, training, and ethical frameworks. The absence of clear direction places a burden on journalists who are largely self-taught, with nearly 60% of AI users learning on their own.

### The Unique Challenges for Emerging Economies
The study also underscores challenges that are particularly acute in the Global South. A primary concern is the inherent bias in many leading AI models, which are often trained on datasets from Western, English-speaking sources. This can perpetuate existing digital divides and create systems that do not accurately reflect local languages and contexts.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of journalists who do not use AI cited a lack of awareness, insufficient training, and limited access to technology as major barriers. This highlights that while the tools exist, the knowledge and infrastructure required to use them equitably are not yet universal.

### The Duality of Impact
Journalists' attitudes towards AI are marked by a fascinating duality: a recognition of its transformative potential coupled with a deep-seated ethical concern. A significant percentage of respondents—over half—feel that AI has had a "great" or "large" impact on their work, yet they simultaneously voice worries about the long-term effects. These include the erosion of critical thinking skills, a decline in original reporting, and the heightened risk of misinformation.

This tempered optimism suggests that journalists view AI not as a replacement, but as an assistant. They are keen to leverage its benefits for routine tasks to free up time for more in-depth, creative, and investigative journalism. The call from the community is clear: they want to see the development of industry-specific ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks that can protect journalistic integrity and foster trust.

Ultimately, the insights from this report provide a powerful message for leaders in media: the AI revolution is not a distant threat or a fleeting trend. It is here, and it is being shaped by journalists on the front lines. The path forward requires a proactive approach to developing clear policies, investing in targeted training, and fostering a culture that views AI as a tool to strengthen, not diminish, the human element of journalism. By addressing these needs, media organizations can ensure AI serves as a catalyst for a more robust and trustworthy news ecosystem for all.
