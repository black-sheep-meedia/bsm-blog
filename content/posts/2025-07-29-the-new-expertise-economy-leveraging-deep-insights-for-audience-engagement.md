News brands have increasingly leaned into podcasts in recent years, attracted by a younger, more affluent, and educated audience and the strong connection listeners often have with their favorite shows. However, news podcast listening remains a relatively niche activity, serving a complementary role in people's news diets rather than being a primary source of information. Understanding the evolving landscape of this format is key for media executives looking to leverage its potential.

One of the most notable shifts [is the rise of video podcasts](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-06/Digital_News-Report_2025.pdf). In the US, for example, 50% of news podcast consumers use YouTube as an access point. This trend blurs the traditional definition of a podcast, with many shows now being filmed and shared on platforms where video is king. However, for news publishers, this presents a nuanced challenge. While video offers opportunities for marketing and reach, the core value of news podcasts for many listeners is their ability to provide information while the audience is engaged in other tasks, such as driving or cooking. The report suggests that for news, listeners are often more interested in the facts and analysis than in watching a host, unlike with entertainment or comedy podcasts.

Despite its niche status, the news podcast audience is highly engaged. A significant 71% of news podcast listeners are extremely or very interested in news, compared to just 45% of non-podcast listeners. This engagement presents a clear opportunity for monetization. While a small number of top shows capture the bulk of ad revenue, publishers are exploring other strategies, such as using podcasts to build loyalty and drive subscriptions to the broader brand. The report indicates a notable willingness to pay for news podcasts, with 46% of listeners in the US, 39% in the UK, and 41% in Norway stating they would be prepared to pay a reasonable price for shows they like.

The most common theme associated with podcasts—and what makes people willing to pay for them—is depth. Listeners consistently mention that podcasts help them understand issues more deeply than other forms of media. This suggests that the true value of a news podcast lies in its ability to offer deep analysis, insights, and unique investigative journalism. For media companies, the path forward may not be in chasing video trends but in focusing on what truly resonates with their audience: using audio and video audio as a powerful tool to provide valuable, in-depth content that complements and enriches the daily news experience.
