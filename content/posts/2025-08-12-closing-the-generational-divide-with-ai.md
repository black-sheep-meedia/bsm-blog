In a media landscape increasingly defined by declining engagement and digital fragmentation, Norway’s public broadcaster, [NRK, is using a simple yet powerful AI tool](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/how-norways-public-broadcaster-uses-ai-generated-summaries-reach-younger-audiences) to reconnect with a crucial demographic: younger audiences. Faced with a steep drop in traditional news consumption among young adults, NRK developed an AI-generated summary box for its articles. The results are a promising look at how technology can make quality journalism more accessible without compromising on content.   

### The Problem: A Shifting Audience
Like many news organizations, NRK is grappling with a generational shift in how people consume information. Data from Statistics Norway shows that print, radio, and television use are all in decline, particularly among 16-24 year olds, only 3% of whom read a print newspaper. To address this, NRK wanted to create a better entry point for its digital articles, allowing readers to quickly grasp a story's content and decide if they want to invest more time. This need led them to an innovative solution: using AI to generate concise, bullet-pointed summaries.

### The Solution: AI-Powered Summaries
NRK's AI tool, developed in collaboration with OpenAI, creates a short summary for each article. Journalists can choose to use the AI-generated text or write their own. For those who opt for the tool, it's a simple process: copy the article URL, and the system provides a summary, along with suggested headlines. This streamlined process has made it easy for journalists to integrate the new feature into their workflow.   

Early data suggests this approach is working. The summaries, which are reviewed by journalists before publication, have proven to be a highly engaging feature. On articles with a summary box, the expansion rate—the percentage of readers who click to read the full summary—is a notable 19%. This rate can soar to nearly 60% for more complex articles, such as those detailing political agreements.

### The Payoff: More Time, More Engagement
Perhaps the most compelling finding is the impact on reader behavior. NRK's data indicates that readers who clicked to expand a summary box spent, on average, 49 seconds on the article page—nearly double the 25 seconds spent by those who did not. This suggests that the summaries act as a valuable filter, helping users identify stories they are genuinely interested in. By giving readers a quick overview, the tool helps them make a confident decision to dive deeper.

While the data is preliminary, it clearly aligns with NRK's goal. Readers under 50 were more likely to expand the summary box than their older counterparts, showing that the feature resonates with the target demographic. This is not about sacrificing depth for speed; it's about using a concise summary to earn the reader’s full attention.

This is a powerful case study for any newsroom looking to adapt to a changing digital landscape. NRK is proving that AI can be a tool for connection, not just automation. By leveraging AI to solve a specific problem—capturing the attention of younger, time-poor audiences—they are building a stronger bridge to their future readership.
