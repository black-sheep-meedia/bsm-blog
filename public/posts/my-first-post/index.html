    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The future of work is not a distant concept; it&rsquo;s already here. According to the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s (WEF) Future of Jobs Report 2025, a staggering 39% of key skills required in the job market will change by 2030. While this number represents a significant shift, it also highlights an even more profound truth for the media industry: the demand for roles driven by technological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI) is growing quickly.</p>
<p>Newsrooms are not blind to this. The latest EBU News Report, &ldquo;Leading Newsrooms in the Age of Generative AI,&rdquo; confirms that news organizations are increasingly using AI tools to improve internal processes. They&rsquo;re implementing custom GPTs and features built into their CMS to enhance performance, a crucial first step in a rapidly evolving landscape.</p>
<p>But a crucial question remains: is this enough?</p>
<p>The answer, as the EBU report suggests, is a resounding no. The success of these projects hinges on a factor far more important than the technology itself: people. Simply automating backend tasks or streamlining distribution is just the beginning. The real challenge—and the immense opportunity—is in bridging the gap between technical potential and human application.</p>
<p>The report reveals a mismatch between the rapid pace of tech development and the capacity of media organizations to truly understand and implement these new tools. AI is not just another tool to make existing jobs easier; it&rsquo;s an agent of transformation that requires a new way of thinking.</p>
<p>This is where upskilling and reskilling become the new competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The media professionals who thrive will be the ones who can go beyond simple automation and leverage AI to deliver a more valuable, personalized, and impactful experience for their audiences. The EBU report provides a glimpse into this future, citing examples of how AI can create &ldquo;very personalized offers&rdquo; to connect with audiences. It shares instances of conversational chatbots that use a news outlet&rsquo;s own content to respond to user queries, and even a &ldquo;comment digest&rdquo; feature that summarizes the key viewpoints in a discussion thread.</p>
<p>The most successful newsrooms won&rsquo;t just ask, &ldquo;How can AI make our jobs faster?&rdquo; They will ask, &ldquo;How can AI make our stories better, our connections deeper, and our journalism more indispensable?&rdquo; The focus will shift from the fear of job replacement to the reality of job evolution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the future of the media landscape isn&rsquo;t about avoiding AI; it&rsquo;s about mastering it. The professionals and organizations that embrace continuous learning and commit to upskilling will be the ones who shape the future of information, not just react to it.</p>
<p>The question for newsrooms today isn&rsquo;t what AI can do, but what a re-skilled and upskilled team can do with it.</p>
